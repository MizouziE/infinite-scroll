# Inifinite Scroll

Initially a small experiment with infinite scroll to develop understanding of functions involved.

```
note - gotta leave this alone for a bit and come back when I understand vue better, the logic is all there, I can't get it in the browser cos I'm not getting the structure. Need to read up a lot on the docs...
```

## Goals

* Understand server AND client side
* Work towards a way to interupt
* See if it's possible to create browser ext to toggle infinite scroll
